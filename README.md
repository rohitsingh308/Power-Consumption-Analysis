# Power-Consumption-Analysis
Energy Consumption Analysis in India (2019-2020)

📌 Overview

India is the world's third-largest producer and consumer of electricity. With a total installed capacity of 370.106 GW (as of March 2020), electricity consumption is a crucial aspect of the country’s economy. This project analyzes electricity consumption state-wise and region-wise from January 2019 to May 2020, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on energy usage trends.

📊 About the Dataset

Context

* The dataset represents India's state-wise electricity consumption over a 17-month period.

* The COVID-19 lockdown (April & May 2020) had a significant impact on economic activities, and this project aims to analyze its effect on energy consumption.

* The data is sourced from Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO), a government enterprise under the Ministry of Power, India.
